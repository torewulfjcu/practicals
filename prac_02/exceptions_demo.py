Answer the following questions:
1. When will a ValueError occur?
2. When will a ZeroDivisionError occur?
3. Could you change the code to avoid the possibility of a ZeroDivisionError?

# ANSWERS
# 1. When the user enters a 'wrong' input. Ex. a string, a float..
# 2. When the user enters 0 when asked for the denominator.
# 3. Use a while loop as shown above.
